# baddrivers
This is a project I am very interested in because I recently got a car and was wondering how New York was compared to other states in terms of insurance, accidents, and premiums
I found this dataset on github and because it was something I liked. The link is https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/edit/master/bad-drivers/bad-drivers.csv
The source for this dataset is from an article https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/
The dataset includes columns such as accident per billion miles, Car insurance premiunms, and percentages of fatal accidents.
This dataset was made in 2014. Numbers could be somewhat different now in 2021
